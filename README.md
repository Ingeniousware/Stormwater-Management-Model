Stormwater-Management-Model (as a Toolkit)
===========================

ORD Stormwater Management Model (aka "SWMM")

Introduction
------------
This is the open source SWMM source code repository maintained by Ingeniousware GmbH. It is mainly oriented (but not limited) to add/extend toolkit capabilities to the SWMM code. This repository includes a solution intended for Visual Studio developers. A c# wrapper of the toolkit is not included here because it has been developed in a different project https://github.com/Ingeniousware/swmm5.net

SWMM is a dynamic hydrology-hydraulic water quality simulation model. It is used for single event or long-term (continuous) simulation of runoff quantity and quality from primarily urban areas. SWMM source code is written in the C Programming Language and released in the Public Domain.

This code respository has been forked from the SWMM source code repository maintained by the Open Water Analytics group.
